# Music-Genre-Classification-using-KNN
This is a machine learning project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify an audio file into its genre.
# KNN
The KNN(K- Nearest Neighbours) Algorithm is a Supervised Machine learning technique that is used for Classification & Regression problems.

It is a non-parametric classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

For this project , I have used the GTZAN dataset for Music Genre Classification. 
This dataset has:

1)genres - A collection of 10 genres with 100 audio files each(30 sec each)

2)images - A visual representation for each audio file. The audio files were converted to Mel Spectrograms to make this possible.

3)2 CSV files - Containing features of the audio files. One file has for each song (30 seconds long) a mean and variance computed over multiple features that can be extracted from an audio file.
